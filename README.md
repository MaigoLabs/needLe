## The Name

The word "needle" is from the phrase [Needle in a Haystack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Needle_in_a_haystack). Normally, searching tasks are finding a small string ("needle") in a large string ("haystack"). However, this project is designed for searching in small strings (specifically, music names) instead of large strings. We are finding needles in needles.

The capitalized "L" is from the music name [needLe](https://projectsekai.fandom.com/wiki/NeedLe).
